          I came into Tech Studio Academy with practically no prior <br> knowledge in software development. However, within a few <br> weeks, I was able to grasp the crux of software development and <br> also master the soft skills required for being a software developer.</p>
       <p>So far so good, the skills acquired have given me a mind-blowing push <br> in my career as a software developer.</p>
